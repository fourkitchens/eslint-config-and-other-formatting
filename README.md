## Tools
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Define the supported node version in a `.nvmrc` file, and then type `nvm use` into the terminal to ensure a consistent developer experience across environments. (The `use` command [can be automated](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#automatically-call-nvm-use) per environment as well)
