## Tools
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Define the supported node version in a `.nvmrc` file, and then type `nvm use` into the terminal to ensure a consistent developer experience across environments. (The `use` command [can be automated](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#automatically-call-nvm-use) per environment as well)
  - Files
    - `.nvmrc`
- Eslint: Javascript
- Stylelint: CSS
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html): Opinionated code formatter with support for many file types. You can configure your [editor to use prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) so that code is formatted on save, for example.
  - Files:
    - `.prettier.json`
    - `.prettierignore`
